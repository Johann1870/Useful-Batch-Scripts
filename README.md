# Useful Batch Scripts

Here are some batch scripts I've found useful over the years and that, TBH I'd probably wish were backed up somewhere if I didn't put them here. Feel free to use. I'll try and keep them somewhat organised and named so people (including me) can find stuff.

I'll try and attribute inspiration where possible. Apologies if I forget.
